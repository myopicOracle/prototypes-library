# The Simple Library

Built with vanilla JavaScript, this project was my first taste of OOP, getting some reps in for prototypal-inheritance, JS classes, constructor functions, DOM manipulation, and local storage.

One of the simplest projects I've done, but easily one of the most memorable && fun.

## What I Learned

- Object-oriented programming with JavaScript classes and prototypes
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Form validation and data persistence
- Responsive web design principles
- Code organization and project structure

## Project Purpose

This project was completed as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum, focusing on:
- Working with constructor functions and object prototypes
- Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Understanding the separation of data and display logic
- Practicing clean, maintainable code structure

This was also the first project in Odin's Javascript Course, which meant it was one of the simplest projects I've ever attempted - but at the same time, this was one of the projects I had the most fun with. Even looking back through the code now, especially the v1 code, a lot of it looks super messy and not DRY, but I can still remember every line.
